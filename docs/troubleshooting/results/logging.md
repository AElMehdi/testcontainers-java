It is hard to help without the logs. Please consider the following:

1. [Configure the logging](../../supported_docker_environment/logging_config.md)
2. Go back and compare the logging output
3. If it doesn't help, share your logs by publishing them to services like [GitHub's gists](http://gist.github.com)  
    and [ask help from the community](../../getting_help.md).
